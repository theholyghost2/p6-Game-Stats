=head1 Population.pm6 and DistributionPopulation.pm6

A Population is a list handle, wrapper to which you can add probabilities,
using the method add($x) and accessing using nth($index).

Expectance() and Variance() functions can be called upon a 
DistributionPopulation which has a Population superclass.

=head2 Covariance.pm6 and Correlation.pm6

Specific classes which are built using 2 distributionpopulations through
Covariance($xpop, $ypop) and Correlation($xpop, $ypop).

=head3 Probability.pm6

The superclass is a DistributionPopulation, methods are :

P($index) gives the nth chance in the population.

Pand($index, $pbconda), P(a) and P(b|a)

Por($index0, $index1, $pbconda), P(a) or P(b|a) 

Porp($index0, $p, $pbconda), as above

CondP($index0, $pbconda), conditional chance, P(b|a), given $pbconda

CalculatedCondP($index0, $n), iterative method for conditional chance

Sometimes P(A|B) = P(A), so ($pbconda and self.P($index) == 1.0)
A and B are disjoint in CondPInd($index0).

Bayes(@indices, @pbconda, $n),
@indices are the indices in @pbconda, $n is the index of the fixed chance.
Exact method for multi variate Bayes function.

=head4 End notes

Most things should be clear from a math point of view. Any statistics
book should give you the data needed to understand the above functionality.
